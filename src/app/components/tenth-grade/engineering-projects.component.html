            <p>An AP Seminar presentation that I did. The presentation was about how the physical and non-physical factors of prison culminate into a prisoner's well being,
                and their ability to reintegrate into society.<br></p>

            <p>This was a part of AP Seminar, that involved me writing an argumentative paper that argued that the physical 
                and non-physical factors of a prison culminated into a prisoner's well being and their ability to reintegrate into society.<br></p>

            <p>This was an engineering makerspace project, 
                where I made a physical chatbot using a raspberry pi that when given a question prompt,
                it would respond with an answer to the prompt.<br></p>

            <p>This was a team makerspace project, where we created a planetary gearbox, a gear system that has a central/large gear, surrounded by smaller gears.
                 When the large gear turned, all of the small gears would turn as well.<br></p>

            <p>This was another team engineering makerspace project where we created these test tube holders, in which these test tubes would hold these flowers.<br></p>
