    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Ram Patel and I am an Engineering Student.<br> 
        My goal one day is to become a software engineer, which is why I decided to<br>
        make a new personal portfolio site with actual code. This was made using Angular, <br>
        a Typescript framework that is used to build large-scale front-end website applications.
